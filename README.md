Code for paper "Object detection through dynamic motor-sensory convergence"

All originally authored MATLAB codes, used in analysis and figure generation, are included here.
The entry-point, which calls upon all other codes, is 'generateAllFigures.m' within the directory Main Flow.

External codes (required):
- Analyses and figure generation rely on several codes by others. We would like to extended our gratitude to the authors of these codes.
These codes are not included here to avoid infringing on rights. They may be obtained independently, as follows:
